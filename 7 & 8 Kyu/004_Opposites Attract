Question:
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each.
If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
/*



//***************Solution********************

//return a boolean value if flower1 modulus 2 is not equal to flower2 modulus 2(a standard way to find odd and even number),
//in other words, return true if odd is not equal to even, or even is not equal to odd.
//Then simiplfied into one line by using an Enumerable methods.
public class LoveDetector
{
    public static bool lovefunc(int flower1, int flower2) => flower1 % 2 != flower2 % 2;
}
