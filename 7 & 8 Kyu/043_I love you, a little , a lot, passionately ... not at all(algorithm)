Question:
Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

I love you
a little
a lot
passionately
madly
not at all
When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.




/*

//***************Solution********************

using System;

public class Kata
{
  public static string HowMuchILoveYou(int nb_petals)
  {
    int count = 0;
    string getText = "";
    string[] text = new string[]{
    "I love you",
    "a little",
    "a lot",
    "passionately",
    "madly",
    "not at all"
    };
    
    //looping count up to 6 times because 6 words
    //can use .Length() for cutomization.
    for (int i = 0; i < nb_petals; i++){
    if(count >= 6){
        count = 0;
    }
    getText = text[count];
    count++;
}
    return getText;
  }
}

Solution 2
using System;

//Predefine the string elements inside the Array
//select the answer by subtract number of petals by 1, and take the modulo of 6
//Then simiplfied into one line by using an Enumerable methods.
public class Kata

  public static string HowMuchILoveYou(int nb_petals)=>  
  new string[] {"I love you", "a little", "a lot", "passionately", "madly", "not at all"}[(nb_petals - 1) % 6];
}
