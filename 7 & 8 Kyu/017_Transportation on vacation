Question:
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).




/*

//***************Solution********************

Solution 1:

//Multiple condition Ternery
//if day is less than 3, multiply by 40
//if day is greater than 2 but less than 7, multiply by 40 then subtract 20
//if day is greater than 7, multiply by 40 then subtract 50
//Then simiplfied into one line by using an Enumerable methods.
public class RentalCar {
    
    public static int RentalCarCost(int d) => d < 3 ? d*40 : (d > 2 && d <7 ? (d*40)-20 : (d * 40) - 50);
}

Solution 2:

//Same as above, but simplifed the structure.
public class RentalCar {    
    public static int RentalCarCost(int d) => d * 40 - (d > 6 ? 50 : d > 2 ? 20 : 0);
}

{

    private static void testing(int actual, int expected) 
    {
        Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual);

[Test]
    public static void test1() 
    {        
        testing(RentalCar.RentalCarCost(1),40);
        testing(RentalCar.RentalCarCost(3),100);
        testing(RentalCar.RentalCarCost(7),230);
    }
}
