Question:
You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

Example(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

6, 10 --> 32
3, 3 --> 9
Note: for the purposes of this kata you will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.

/*

//***************Solution********************

//if length is equal to width, then it is a squre, find the area.
//else find the perimeter.
//Then simiplfied into one line by using an Enumerable methods.
public class MathCheck {
    public static int AreaOrPerimeter(int l, int w) => l == w ? l * w : (l + w) * 2;
}

//****************Sample Test*****************

namespace AreaOrPerimter {
  using NUnit.Framework;
  using System;
  [TestFixture]
  public class Test
  {
    [Test]
    public void FixedTest()
    {
      Assert.AreEqual(MathCheck.AreaOrPerimeter(4, 4), 16);
      Assert.AreEqual(MathCheck.AreaOrPerimeter(6, 10), 32);
    }
  }
}
